This is a simulator for the Go 1.5 garbage collector pacing algorithm
proposed in https://golang.org/s/go15gcpacing

Run `./simulate --help` for simulation options. The simulator outputs
simple tab-separated tables. This repository includes various scripts
to plot these using [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/).
